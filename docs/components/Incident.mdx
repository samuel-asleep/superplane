## Instructions

## API integration

1. In [incident.io Settings > API keys](https://app.incident.io/settings/api-keys), click **Create API key** and give it a name.
2. Under **Add permissions**, select exactly these (use "Find a permission" if needed):
   - **View data, like public incidents and organisation settings** (needed to read severities)
   - **Create incidents** (needed for the Create Incident action)
   - **View all incident data, including private incidents** (only if you use private incidents)
3. Create the key and **paste the API key** in the Configuration section below.

## On Incident

The On Incident trigger starts a workflow execution when incident.io sends webhooks for incident created or updated events.

### Use Cases

- **Incident automation**: Notify Slack, update a status page, or create a Jira ticket when an incident is opened or updated
- **Notification workflows**: Send notifications when incidents are created or their status changes
- **Integration workflows**: Sync incidents with external systems

### Configuration

- **Events**: Select which events to listen for (Incident created, Incident updated)
- **Webhook signing secret**: Use the **Set signing secret** action below (after creating the webhook in incident.io) to store the signing secret. It is stored securely and never in the workflow configuration.

### Webhook Setup

incident.io does not provide an API to register webhook endpoints. After adding this trigger:

1. Save the canvas to generate the webhook URL, then copy it from this panel.
2. In incident.io go to **Settings > Webhooks** and create a new endpoint with that URL.
3. Subscribe to **Public incident created (v2)** and **Public incident updated (v2)**.
4. Copy the **Signing secret** from the endpoint, then use **Set signing secret** below to store it securely.

    "event_type": "public_incident.incident_created_v2",
