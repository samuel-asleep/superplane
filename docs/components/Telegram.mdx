## Instructions

To set up Telegram integration:

1. Get a bot token from @BotFather and paste it in the field below
2. Disable privacy mode so the bot can receive messages in groups: send /setprivacy to @BotFather, select your bot, and choose Disable
3. Add the bot to your group or channel

Note: if the bot was already in a group before disabling privacy mode, remove and re-add it for the change to take effect.

## On Mention

The On Mention trigger starts a workflow execution when the Telegram bot is mentioned in a message.

### Use Cases

- **Bot commands**: Process commands from Telegram messages
- **Bot interactions**: Create interactive Telegram bots
- **Team workflows**: Trigger workflows from Telegram conversations
- **Notification processing**: Process and respond to mentions

### Configuration

- **Chat ID**: Optional chat filter - if specified, only mentions in this chat will trigger (leave empty to listen to all chats)

### Event Data

Each mention event includes:
- **message_id**: The unique message identifier
- **from**: User who mentioned the bot
- **chat**: Chat where the mention occurred
- **text**: The message text containing the mention
- **date**: Unix timestamp of the message

### Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a webhook subscription when configured. The subscription is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

### Example Data

```json
{
  "data": {
    "chat": {
      "id": -9876543210,
      "title": "My Group",
      "type": "group"
    },
    "date": 1737028800,
    "entities": [
      {
        "length": 6,
        "offset": 0,
        "type": "mention"
      }
    ],
    "from": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "id": 111222333,
      "is_bot": false,
      "username": "johndoe"
    },
    "message_id": 1234,
    "text": "@mybot hello!"
  },
  "type": "telegram.message.mention"
}
```

## Send Message

The Send Message component sends a text message to a Telegram chat.

### Use Cases

- **Notifications**: Send notifications about workflow events or system status
- **Alerts**: Alert teams about important events or errors
- **Updates**: Provide status updates on long-running processes
- **Bot interactions**: Send automated responses to users

### Configuration

- **Chat ID**: The Telegram chat ID (can be a user, group, or channel)
- **Text**: The message text to send
- **Parse Mode**: Optional formatting mode (Markdown)

### Output

Returns metadata about the sent message including message ID, chat ID, text, and timestamp.

### Notes

- The bot must have permission to post messages in the specified chat
- For groups and channels, add the bot as a member first
- Use parse mode for rich text formatting in your messages
- Chat ID can be negative for groups and channels

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "chat_id": -9876543210,
    "date": 1737028800,
    "message_id": 1234,
    "text": "Hello from SuperPlane"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-16T12:00:00.000Z",
  "type": "telegram.message.sent"
}
```

## Wait for Button Click

The Wait for Button Click component sends a message to a Telegram chat with inline keyboard buttons and waits for the user to click one of the configured buttons.

### Use Cases

- **Request approval or input**: Get structured input from a user in Telegram before applying or deploying (e.g., Approve / Reject buttons)
- **Pause a workflow**: Wait until a human selects an option (e.g., Confirm / Cancel)
- **Implement interactive flows**: Create interactive flows that need a structured reply via buttons

### Configuration

- **Chat ID**: Telegram chat ID (user, group, or channel) to post to (required)
- **Message**: Message text (required)
- **Timeout**: Maximum time to wait in seconds (optional)
- **Buttons**: Set of 1–4 items, each with name (label) and value (required)

### Output Channels

- **Received**: Emits when the user clicks a button; payload includes the selected value and clicker info (when available)
- **Timeout**: Emits when no button click is received within the configured timeout

### Behavior

- The message is posted with inline keyboard buttons
- The workflow pauses until a button is clicked or timeout occurs
- Only the first button click is processed; subsequent clicks are ignored
- If timeout is not configured, the component waits indefinitely

### Notes

- The Telegram bot must be added to the chat and have permission to post messages
- Button clicks are processed through Telegram's callback query API

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clicked_at": "2026-02-10T21:00:00Z",
    "clicked_by": {
      "id": 123456789,
      "username": "john"
    },
    "value": "approve"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-02-10T21:00:00Z",
  "type": "telegram.button.clicked"
}
```
